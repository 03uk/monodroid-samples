Maps and Location Demo
======================

This is the sample code for the [Maps and Location article](http://docs.xamarin.com/android/tutorials/Maps_and_Location). The code in this project is for the [Google Maps for Android v1](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/v1/), which was officially deprecated on December 2, 2012. 

Applications will continue to work with the Google Maps v1 API, but starting March 3, 2013 Google will not issue any more API keys for the is version of Google Maps.

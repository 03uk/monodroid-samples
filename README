MonoDroid samples, showing use of Android API wrappers from C#.

Samples:
=======

The following samples are provided:

  - Button: A full-screen button with click counter, demonstrates use of C#
    events to handle UI events.

  - GLCube: A static image shown via OpenGLES and OpenTK, via AndroidGameView.

  - HelloWorld: A port of the simple Android Hello World application.
    Also demonstrates use of resources.

  - MultiResolution: Demonstrates embedded resources and UI integration.

  - SkeletonApp: Demonstrates text editing and keyboard support.

  - TexturedCube: OpenGLES and OpenTK demonstration.  Drag the cube around to
    see it rotate.

Building:
========

In order to build, the following must be installed first:

  - Android SDK, containing at least API level 7 (Android 2.1)
  - Java SDK
  - MonoDroid SDK

Once the MonoDroid SDK tools and the Android SDK have been installed, there are 
two ways to build the various samples:

  - Open */*.sln within Visual Studio 2010.

    MonoDevelop support is forthcoming.

  - Using the Unix makefiles.  These *require* xbuild from Mono 2.6.7 
    (or later), and the TARGETS_DIR, ANDROID_SDK_PATH, and topdir make(1) 
    variables:

	make ANRDROID_SDK_PATH=/path/to/android/sdk/root \
	  TARGETS_DIR=/path/containing/Novell/Novell.MonoDroid.Common.targets \
	  topdir=/path/to/mondroid/install

    ANDROID_SDK_PATH is the root directory of your Android SDK install

    TARGETS_DIR is the directory containing the file
    'Novell\Novell.MonoDroid.Common.targets'.

    topdir is also used to find the MonoDroid Install directory.

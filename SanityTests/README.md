Sanity Tests
============

SanityTests is a hodgepodge of things to test various interactions,
such as SQLite use, JNI use, P/Invoke use, SSL, compression, and all
manner of other things.

This sample is _not_ a "HOWTO" guide for how to 'properly' (sanely) do
something; it's our internal "test suite" (ha!) "thrown over the wall"
as it answers frequently recurring questsions on the mailing list,
such as how to use Android.Runtime.JNIEnv, Java integration, and more.

Ideally such things will be split out into separate, easily digestible
samples in the future (presumably as part of ApiDemo), but in the
interest of expediency...

NFCSample
=========

This sample application demonstrate using Near Field Communications (NFC) to read and write from an NFC tag. The application will write a string to an NFC tag. Then when the application detects the NFC tag that it had previously written, it will read that string and display an image associated with that string.

This application targets API 15 (Android 4.0.3) but should be easily adaptable to API level 10 (Android 2.3.3).
